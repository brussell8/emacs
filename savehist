Some ideas about what this book is not

It is not a telling of a dystopian future that reflects America as it is now.

It is not a reflection of a present-day culture of corporate oppression and greed and patriarchy and gender oppression.

It is not a picture of a present-day Hobbesian war of all against all, with anarchy and random violence fueled by drug-addicted criminals just around the corner.

It is an interesting thought-exercise in what it would be like to be a super-empath with a deep instinct for survival notwithstanding being a minority and subject to racism -- racism doesn't figure altogether prominently in this novel. I'm not sure Butler carries this super-empath notion very far successfully.

It is an interesting thought-exercise in what a teenager might develop as a religion in contrast to the orthodox views of her father. God is not simply change or just any change.

"Spinoff of Viatris (VTRS) from Pfizer (PFE)
Pfizer spun off its Upjohn unit which immediately merged with Mylan to form Viatris, effective November 16, 2020 in a transaction meant to be tax-free to Pfizer shareholders. Viatris began normal trading on November 16, 2020.

NOTE: As of 11/20/20, these steps are only for Pfizer Shareholders. We are continuing to work on steps for Mylan shareholders. Please check back for those steps at a later time.
This action is a standard spinoff transaction in the accounting software. It is structured to be a non-taxable event for Pfizer shareholders. The cost basis allocation information is calculated from the average of the opening and closing prices of VTRS and PFE on the effective date of the spinoff. Neither company has posted guidance on their websites on cost allocation at the time these instructions were written.

NOTE:

The cost basis allocation is dependent on the prices used for both Pfizer and Viatris in the cost basis allocation calculations. In our experience brokers tend to use the prices found in the guidance companies post on their websites including IRS form 8937. If your broker does not use that guidance, the cost basis of the companies involved as recorded in your accounting records and in your broker’s records will not match. This is not cause for concern. This is just due to the inexact nature of the tax code in this regard. Partnership tax returns have specific areas to reconcile these usually small differences. ICLUBcentral tax printer software automatically fills in these adjustments in the normal operation of the software using the data imported from your accounting records and that you enter from your 1099
